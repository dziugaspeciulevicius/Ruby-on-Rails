# SORT STRING WORDS BY LENGTH
#
# Create a method named 'sort_string' which accepts a String and rearranges all the words in ascending order, by
# length. Let's not treat the punctuation marks any different than other characters and assume that we will always have
# single space to separate the words.
#
# Example: Given a string "Sort words in a sentence", it should return "a in Sort words sentence".
#
# Note: You can use the sort method to sort an array. Try the documentation at ruby-lang to know more about sort.
#

def sort_string(string)
  string.split(' ').sort { |x, y| x.length <=> y.length }.join(' ')
end

puts 'Enter a sentence:'
sentence = gets
puts sort_string sentence
