From https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer solve 3 problems (bottom of the page) of your choice.


### TASK2
***Task description:***

Select any programming task from previous or ongoing courses (like C, Java and etc.) and rewrite them in Ruby language.

### TASK3
***Task description:***

For all programs in Task 2 make the following changes:

1. Rewrite code according to Object-Oriented programming paradigm.

2. Install Gem: Rubocop

3. Fix all Rubocop errors.


### TASK4
***Task description:***

Select any Test Framework of your choice (for example Ruby Unit Test).

Using Test Framework, write tests for Task 3 programs (1 program per person).

In this task I used RSpec to test my application. RSpec is a testing tool for for Ruby applications. It is considered a 
behavior driven development framework. The tests look at a ruby object or class, 
and describes what that object should be doing. It is intended to be very intuitive, like the rest of ruby. 
It's used in a lot of ruby and rails enterprise level applications.

[You can find a link for documentation here.](http://rspec.info/documentation/) 

To get started with RSpec first we need to install rspec:
```
gem install rspec
```

To set it up in a project, run this command below:
```
rspec --init
```
